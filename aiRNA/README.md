# aiRNA Pipeline
This aiRNA pipeline is designed to identify antisense intron mapping smRNAs from smRNA datasets.
The workflow is broken up into 2 notebooks:
1. `prepare_intron_map.ipynb` describes the process of preparing and filtering an intron database. For our work we used genetic data from the C. elegans species, but this process can be easily applied to other species.
2. `antisense_intron_pipeline.ipynb` describes the process of mapping smRNAs to the antisense strands of introns.
